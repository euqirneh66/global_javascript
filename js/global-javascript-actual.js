/* Welcome to Global Javascript!
	
If you are familiar with Javascript, you may delete these comments and get started. Javascript allows websites to have dynamic content. Here's an example:

alert("Hello");

That line will display a popup message box that says "Hello" without the quotes.

Javascript is not very hard to learn. There are many free references to help you get started, like http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp

We hope you enjoy developing your custom JS. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
 - You cannot edit the Javascript of your themes and other plugins. The Javascript you create will be loaded after all the other Javascript is loaded.
 - Anything inside Javascript comments will not be outputted */
